# Bechdel Test automation to determine female presence in movies.


### Goal

The purpose of this project is to create a tool to determine if a film passes the Bechdel test based on its script and its characteristics.
For this, on the one hand, an analysis of the scripts of 300 movies using Python has been performed to write and execute the algorithm; On the other hand, various Machine Learning techniques have been applied to classify films based on their genre and year of publication, also with Python as the main tool.


### Tools Needed

In order to reproduce this project, it is necessary to carry out the following steps:

1. Have the Conda package manager installed.
2. Click on the following public Google Drive link, and download the full folder that is located there (https://drive.google.com/open?id=14kBRVQ3cwLBy137NCSFI8zelHOY08_av)
3. Install in conda the enviroment that is inside this folder, called "coral_garcia_tfm_enviroment.yml".
To carry out this step, it is necessary to follow the following instructions:

Use the Terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps.
- Create the environment from the "coral_garcia_tfm_enviroment.yml" file:

                              >conda env create -f coral_garcia_tfm_enviroment.yml
                              
-Activate the new environment:

Windows:                      
                              
                               > activate coral_garcia_tfm_enviroment
macOS and Linux:              

                              >source activate coral_garcia_tfm_enviroment

-Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:

                              >conda list

4. Open the memory of the TFM, in order to be able to follow the steps that have been carried out throughout the code, and the results that have been obtained. The rest of the necessary instructions are found in this document, including a description of all the files contained in the folder TFM_FINAL
